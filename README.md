# a discord bot

*For my small server with friends to play games.*

It's around christmas 2021 and I came up with a genius idea about this bot project. 

Since we will start learning JavaScript after new year, I will note what I learn in school and apply it here. It can be an interesting experience. Because after a month on this bot I honestly do not know what I am doing. It is mostly trial and error in the dark and mostly copy paste. ðŸ™ˆ


## My goals with this discord bot

- [x] Be able to delete several messages in a channel. (it was an example function, so purely copy paste)
- [x] Be able to get some information about a user. (it was an example function, so purely copy paste)
- [x] Be able to see a users avatar. (it was an example function, so purely copy paste)
- [ ] Some small game maybe?
- [ ] Search a mediaWiki (maybe it would be possible to search the wiki from the game?) 
- [ ] Reaction / command roles for members to assign to themself
    - [ ] Prononuns
    - [ ] Open to DMs / Ask before DMs / No DMs
    - [ ] Languages they speak
    - [ ] Type of gamer Chill / Builder / Collector / Acevement hunter / Fighter / Explorer / AFKer / Digger

## Things I've learned so far in school

>*Javascript with ES6*  
>*from beginning of January to the end of February, 2022.*

### Many types of functions

Some of the things we talked about was different ways of creating functions. I have used regular `functions()` before so that's no problem, but function expression, anonymous functions and arrow functions are new to me.

I am beginning to understand the "base code" in this project much better as they've used these other types of functions.. This is exiting!

*(Also, apparently Javascript was created the same year as I was, 1995.)* 

### Relearning basic stuff

We have so far learnt about different functions, variables, ways to work with arrays, loops, objects and DOM-three, some basic stuff I guess. 
I've been slightly familiar with most of the things, but I've learned many new ways to do them. I feel like my previous code could almost have been written in the stone age, haha.

Oh, and I must say, things are getting clearer and clearer.

### Event listeners

We have talked about eventListeners, not really relevant. I mean, there are event handelers in the bot, but they are for my untraind eyes so different that I don't see any recemblance to the eventListeners we have learned. 

### Modules

Since I've learnd modules in the context of frontend dev these in the bot are a bit different. But it still makes more sense to me now, than before. 

### APIs and asyncronus stuff

We finaly got to APIs, asynconus programming, promises. I didn't realise that when fetching audit logs, it's an API I'm working, so that was fun!

I realise I use it when working with the audit log and I will have even more use of it later when I make the mediaWiki search.
