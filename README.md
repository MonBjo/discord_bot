# a discord bot

Just following the discordjs.guide to remake my discord bot. I originally started on this project a year ago, in 2021. But I got super busy with school and then summer job. Since then I've learned a lot about writing code. A classmate suggested that I would write my bot at Autocode, and so I did. It went pretty smooth and I learned some new things about discord. After hitting the request limit tho I decided to move over to Github again!

So here I am.
