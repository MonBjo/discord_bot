# a discord bot

*For my small server with friends to play minecraft.*

It's around christmas 2021 and I came up with a genius idea about this bot project. 

Since we will start learning JavaScript after new year, I will note what I learn in school and apply it here. It can be an interesting experience. Because after a month on this bot I honestly do not know what I am doing. It is mostly trial and error in the dark and copy paste. ðŸ™ˆ


### My goals with this discord bot

- [x] Be able to delete several messages in a channel.
- [x] Be able to get information about a user. 
- [x] Be able to see a users avatar. 
- [ ] Handle audit logs
    - [x] Deleted messages
    - [ ] Updated messages
    - [ ] A user leaves the server
- [ ] Some small game maybe?
- [ ] Search the minecraft wiki (maybe it would be possible to search the wiki from the game?)
- [ ] Reaction / command roles for members to assign to themself
    - [ ] Prononuns
    - [ ] Open to DMs / Ask before DMs / No DMs

### Things I've learned so far in school and how I apply it in my code

Sit down. We haven't even started the course yet.
