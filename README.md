# a discord bot

*For my small server with friends to play minecraft.*

It's around christmas 2021 and I came up with a genius idea about this bot project. 

Since we will start learning JavaScript after new year, I will note what I learn in school and apply it here. It can be an interesting experience. Because after a month on this bot I honestly do not know what I am doing. It is mostly trial and error in the dark and copy paste. ðŸ™ˆ


## My goals with this discord bot

- [x] Be able to delete several messages in a channel. (it was an example function, so purely copy paste)
- [x] Be able to get some information about a user. (it was an example function, so purely copy paste)
- [x] Be able to see a users avatar. (it was an example function, so purely copy paste)
- [ ] Handle audit logs
    - [x] Deleted messages
    - [ ] Updated messages
    - [ ] A user leaves the server
- [ ] Some small game maybe?
- [ ] Search the minecraft wiki (maybe it would be possible to search the wiki from the game?) 
- [ ] Reaction / command roles for members to assign to themself
    - [ ] Prononuns
    - [ ] Open to DMs / Ask before DMs / No DMs
    - [ ] Languages they speak

## Things I've learned so far in school and how I apply it in my code

### Week 1 
*January 10*

This week we have talked some basics, some of the things we talked about was different ways of creating functions. I have used regular `functions()` before so that's no problem, but function expression, anonymous functions and arrow functions are new to me.

I am beginning to understand the "base code" in this project much better as they've used these other types of functions.. This is exiting!

*Also, apparently Javascript was created the same year as I was, 1995.*

### Week 2

There was some anonyumous one-liner arrow functions and they're really hard for me to read, especally with only one argument. So I tweaked them to be on multiple lines. 

I do understand that the one-liners are useful and probably easy to read for skilled devs. I'll get there soon!

Other than that we have done some basics like object and arrays and those aren't really relevant for now.
